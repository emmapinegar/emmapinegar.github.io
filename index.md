## Emma Pinegar

I'm a first year PhD student studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Utah. I earned my BS in Computer Science also from the University of Utah in Fall 2021.  

## Experience
I am currently a graduate student researcher at the Utah Wearable Robotics Lab directed by Dr. Haohan Zhang. I am primarily focusing on robotics applications that help treat medical conditions or improve the quality of life of disabled persons. 

## Projects
I have worked on several projects recently, the most notable being:
- A magnetically actuated cannula which resulted in a HAMLYN Symposium publication
- 3D object reconstruction in scenes with multiple objects
- Android app with remote music controls, texting, dialing, toggling do not disturb, etc. using an Arduino with gesture recognition
- Industrial inspection of Coca Cola bottles using the image processing toolbox in Matlab
- Baxter pick-and-place using contrained 6 DOF inverse kinematics
