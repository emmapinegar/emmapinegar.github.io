## Emma Pinegar

I am a undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University of Utah graduating Fall 2021. I am currently completing a senior capstone project with three teammates and researching at the Learning Lab for Manipulation Autonomy. 

I am passionate about robotics and find medical robotics particularly fascinating. In the fall I will be taking graduate courses in mechanical engineering and computer science with a focus on robotics. 

## Experience
I am currently an undergraduate researcher with the Learning Lab for Manipulation Autonomy and will be continuing to do so for the forseeable future. 

## Projects
I have worked on several projects recently, the most notable being:
- 3D object reconstruction in scenes with multiple objects
- Android app with remote music controls, texting, dialing, toggling do not disturb, etc. using an Arduino with gesture recognition
- Industrial inspection of Coca Cola bottles using the image processing toolbox in Matlab
- Baxter pick-and-place using contrained 6 DOF inverse kinematics
